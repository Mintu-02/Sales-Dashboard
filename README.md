I honed skills to create impactful visual representations that described stories hidden behind the data. Where I have used some advance visuals such as MAP, Forecasting sale trend and Advanced filters etc.

This working experience has built expertise my understanding of data’s potential and equipped me with practical skills in data analysis and visualization.
